# C Programming Exercises

This repository contains my personal exercises and practice programs in C, organized by topics.  
Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or concept in C programming, and each file contains a separate exercise.

## Structure

- `01_Basics/` – Basic programs: Hello World, variables, input/output, etc.
- `02_Conditions/` – Conditional statements: if, else, switch.
- `03_Loops/` – Loops: for, while, do-while.
- `04_Functions/` – Functions: defining, calling, passing arguments.
- (Add more folders as you progress with other topics: arrays, pointers, structs, file I/O, etc.)

## Usage

Compile each C file individually using:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o filename
./filename
```
Or use the provided Makefile (if available) to compile all exercises at once.
Notes

    Each exercise is meant for learning and practicing specific C concepts.

    Code is written for clarity and learning purposes, not for production.
