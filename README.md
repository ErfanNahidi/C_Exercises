# C Programming Exercises

This repository contains my personal exercises and practice programs in C, organized by topics.  
Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or concept in C programming, and each file contains a separate exercise.

## Usage

Compile each C file individually using:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o filename
./filename
```
Or use the provided Makefile (if available) to compile all exercises at once.
Notes

    Each exercise is meant for learning and practicing specific C concepts.

    Code is written for clarity and learning purposes, not for production.
